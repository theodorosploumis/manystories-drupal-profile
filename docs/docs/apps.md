## Many Stories, Many Apps
> A guide to create Apps using the ManyStories project APIs.

This is the repository for the Apps that are using the APIs and data from [manystoriesoneheart.gr](http://manystoriesoneheart.gr).

There is a website for these Apps at: **[manystories.github.io/apps](http://manystories.github.io/apps)**.

You can create an App too and get it listed here.

### Available APIs

#### 1. RESTful API

[manystoriesoneheart.gr/api](http://manystoriesoneheart.gr/api)

Documentation about this API can be found at [restapi](restapi).

#### 2. SPARQL API

[manystoriesoneheart.gr/sparql](http://manystoriesoneheart.gr/sparql)

### License of the Data

All the data are available under [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) but this can change. In any case the license will be an Open license and it will be compatible with the [CKAN](http://ckan.org/) platforms.

Furthermore the license can be found on the API resource of each item ([example](http://manystoriesoneheart.gr/api/stories/bf988052-22a4-402e-bf1d-7b42ef8b79b2)).

### License of the Apps
You must have an **open source license** for your App. If you are not sure about the license take some help at [choosealicense.com](http://choosealicense.com/). The license must be included on your App folder as txt or md file.

### How to submit an App
You can make a **pull request** on this repository. Of course you need to fork it first.

### Are there any html markup that need to contain in a web App
You are free to create your App as you prefer. There are no any styling guidelines etc. Though it would be fair to contain the information below on the top, sidebar or bottom of your App which are:

- The source code of the App (pointing on the app subfolder on repo [github.com/manystories/apps](https://github.com/manystories/apps))
- A valid title
- The license of the App as link
- The [logo](http://manystoriesoneheart.gr/sites/all/themes/manystories/logo.png) of the website linked to the [main website](http://manystoriesoneheart.gr/)

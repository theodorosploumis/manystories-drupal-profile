## Terms of Use

### Introduction

Welcome to ManyStoriesOneHeart.gr!

This project is an official submission for the 2016 [Apps4Thessaloniki competition - Tourism edition](http://thessaloniki.appsforgreece.eu/en).

If you need to learn more about MSOH and its purpose please check the [About](about) and [FAQs](faqs) pages.

ManyStoriesOneHeart.gr ("MSOH") is a web portal in which registered users ("MEMBERS") can create small articles ("STORIES") as also as browse the published STORIES. Anonymous users ("ANONYMOUS") can still do everything on MSOH except from creating STORIES.

From this point with the term "MSOH" we mean not only the website itself but also the SERVICES ("SERVICES") available such as the RESTful API, the SPARQL API, the RSS feed etc.

By using MSOH, you are agreeing that you, and each person you allow to access it as a MEMBER or ANONYMOUS, will abide by the terms of the following Agreement, which is summarized here, and set forth in its entirety below.

This Agreement is between you and MSOH, and it governs your access to and use of the SERVICES offered under the domain ManyStoriesOneHeart.gr (the "WEBSITE"). Your access to and use of the WEBSITE is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with this Agreement.

### MEMBER STORIES

- You shouldn’t post any STORY or use our SERVICES to do anything illegal or malicious.
- If it turns out any of your STORIES or use is illegal or malicious, MSOH is not responsible - you are responsible.
- Please do not hack, attack, or make unfair use of our SERVICES.
- If disputes arise between you and anyone other than MSOH, we have no obligation to participate or assist either party.

MSOH reserves the right, but is not obligated, to unpublish, backup locally, edit or delete any STORY that MSOH in its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, violations of these Terms of Use.

MSOH will respond to all such notices, including as required or appropriate by removing the infringing material or disabling all links to the infringing material. MSOH will terminate a visitor's access to and use of the Services if, under appropriate circumstances, the visitor is determined to be a repeat infringer of the copyrights or other intellectual property rights of MSOH or others. In the case of such termination, MSOH will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts previously paid to MSOH.

### Logo and slogan copyright

The logo used on MSOH as also as the slogan "Many Stories One Heart" is owned by the Municipality of Thessaloniki ("MUT"). We are not going to claim any ownership of the brand and we are not officially associated with MUT or any other public sector organization.

If you are a legal representative of MUT please contact us at help [at] manystoriesoneheart [dot] gr to inform us about misuse of the brand elements or any other issue that may arise.

### Embeded media copyright

According to the EU law embedding in a website of a work which is publicly accessible on another website by means of a link using the framing technology does not by itself constitute communication to the public within the meaning of to the extent that the relevant work is neither communicated to a new public nor by using a specific technical means different from that used for the original communication.

Furthermore by using embeded media (to create a STORY) you agree to the terms of use of the media provider (eg Youtube, Flickr, Pinterest etc).

For legal matters we do not provide the embeded source code on the MSOH APIs but only the initial link of the media.
